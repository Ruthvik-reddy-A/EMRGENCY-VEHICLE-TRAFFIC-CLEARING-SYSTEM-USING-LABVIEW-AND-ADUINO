# Emergency vehicle traffic clearing system
To design and develop a working component on a traffic signal, which detects the presence of an Emergency Vehicle in a specific range and automatically changes the traffic signal of that path into GREEN and changes the other signals into RED, allowing the Emergency Vehicles to move with minimal traffic restrictions and reaching their destination as soon as possible.  
This model has been implemented using Arduino and Labview software
